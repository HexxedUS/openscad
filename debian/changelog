  * [f3d16e2] Multiple non-MDI assumptions were made, setting CWD and assuming it didn't change. Fix required to pass more context to nodes (functions). It's not totally clean, but it's a start. Fixes bugs: opening multiple files simultaneously only loaded the first file, refreshing an scad file referencing an external file failed if another scad file was opened in the meantime.

    I added a simple p2nef2 based on what projection.cc was doing, and
    applied it to the outer_boundary of the polygon_with_holes_2. It now
    seems to work for simple scad code such as:
    minkowski() {

    This reverts commit 060a6c654de5ebd14ccb889881fa6c4d3fb9d763.
    The reason is that the output DXF won't import in a number of applications due to a malformed DXF (AutoCAD, Solidworks). The correct fix is probably to use a DXF library to generate a correct DXF. This is only a case for more recent (R14+) versions of DXF, e.g. to be able to use the LWPOLYLINE entity.

  [ chrysn ]
  * [400248d] renamed dumptest files to .csg and added group headers
  * [00e29e9] changed group headers to empty group headers
    this became necessary because the batch editing in the last commit
    didn't respect that an empty group is not group() { } but group();
  * [850058e] trim precision in dumptest regressions
    in order for them to work against openscad's .csg output, the number of
    decimal places was reduced.
  * [84857ac] modify root modifier example now that the test program respects the root modifier
    as the dumptests are now run from a full openscad, the root modifier is
    respected by the test program too; reflectin that in the unit test
  * [7d53e56] use openscad as a replacement for dumptest and echotest
    the echotest and dumptest still contain hacks to keep the delta to the
    original unit tests minimal; possibly, some of these changes will make
    it into the openscad program, at which time they can go away from there.
  * [770cb09] trim precision from the echo tests
    as it was done with dumptest before
  * [887c475] drop cgalpngtest for openscad drop in replacement
  * [06fd345] drop cgalpngtest all together
    replaced in CMakeLists.txt with direct openscad call, and duplicate
    checks removed
    cgalpngtest_text-search-test was left in the Heavy configuration,
    resolving the ambiguity of it being heavy with cgalpngtest and not with
    openscad-cgalpng (which does the same thing)
  * [2006824] drop moduledumptest, use `openscad -o ${NAME}.ast`
    src/openscad.cc code was copy/pasted from .csg section; some refactoring
    might make things nicer, but i didn't dare change too much for lack of
    language knowledge
  * [1d17e62] make test_pretty_print.py work with .csg and .ast too
    file results that were neither txt nor png used to be ignored silently;
    now, unknown extensions produce errors, and csg and ast are known.
  * [3460564] renamed csgtermtest to .term
  * [0eb64d8] ctest infrastructure for native .term tests
  * [b7170fe] add .term output for CSG term export
  * [17cd6d1] switch opencsgtest to native binary
  * [a4b5449] remove test binaries for cgsltest, csgtermtest and opencsgtest
  * [077332f] normalize -nan and -0 in all output modes
    having a stable output is not only relevant in testing, and with the
    main binary being used for more tests, having those normalizations takes
    load off the preparing scripts tests/{dumptest,echotest}

  [ Marius Kintel ]

  * [28e420d] replace echotest and dumptest with python scripts
    this solves problems of sed compatibility on different platoforms.
    also, the openscad binary to use is now passed in from the ctest script.
  * [4d18db6] python validation for cgal stl sanity test
    this drops another static binary and replaces it with a very small
    shell^Wpython script (again, python used to avoid sed / grep
    implementation differences)

  [ Marius Kintel ]
  * [6082daf] Re-enable tests which previously cause floating point comparison issues
  * [5a43874] cgalstlsanitytest moved
  * [c3e7d4b] dumptest now supports the root modifier - updated test results
  * [70247b7] Ported use of check_output to Python-2.6

  [ Ivo Noorhoff ]
  * [61e6178] In this commit i'll change just the Qt project, c and header files to get OpenSCAD building and working on Windows 7 compiled with Visual Studio Express 2012.
    A couple of things needed changing :
    * MSVC 2012 has no trunc or round, i have added those to mathc99 and included mathc99 to the files needed.
    The implementations were taken from boost.
    * MSVC 2012 stl does now allow accessing out of bounds elements in std:vector as an array, so "chain->objects[i]" will
    fail in "OpenCSGRenderer::renderCSGChain". Whatever the platform, it will me a good idea to change this
    code to something that does not trigger undefined behavior.
    * MSVC 2012 cannot figure out the types involved in "if (file_size ==  80 + 4 + 50*facenum) {", i have added
    a cast to force it to "if (file_size ==  static_cast<std::streamoff>(80 + 4 + 50*facenum)) {".
    The next round would be regression testing and debugging and possibly more changes to the OpenSCAD main code.
    The round after that would be changing the .pro and .pri files to create correct visual studio solutions.

  * [400d28d] Enable module stack introspection from within an SCAD script.
    The _current_module and _parent_module variables have been replaced
    by a built-in function parent_module(n). It takes one numeric parameter n,
    and returns n-th element from the module stack. If no argument provided,
    n defaults to 1 and the function returns the name of the direct parent
    module. If n is equal 0 current module name is returned.

        openscad.desktop: error: value "Graphics;3DGraphics;Engineering;Programming;" for key "Categories" in group "Desktop Entry" contains an unregistered value "Programming"; values extending the format should start with "X-"
    This changes it to Development, witch is a valid category listed in Additional Categories. Now desktop-file-validate only gives us a hint:
        openscad.desktop: hint: value "Graphics;3DGraphics;Engineering;Development;" for key "Categories" in group "Desktop Entry" contains more than one main category; application might appear more than once in the application menu.

    Polygons were clipped too soon, resulting in numerical robustness errors
    which could create cracks in the resulting geometry. This patch corrects
    the problem by postponing Clipper's union operation until the Minkowski
    insides are filled. The result is also a net reduction of the number
    of Clipper operations.

    The old polygon simplification algorithm in toPolygon2D() was broken.
    It could create self-intersecting paths which made CGAL barf and
    resulted in non-manifold meshes. It has been replaced with the one
    built into Clipper. I am not sure Clipper's is guaranteed to be
    correct either, but it at least seems to have fewer fail cases.

  * [b7d9abd] Speed up 3d convex hull()
    Speed up hull() significantly by removing duplicate points prior to calling CGAL::convex_hull_3.
    Most computation now lies in converting the resulting CGAL::Polyhedron -> CGAL::Nef_polyhedron_3.
    Also, enables convex hulls to be computed on non-manifold geometry.
  * [2e61967] Performance: Speed up CGAL n-ary union.
    By utilizing CGAL::Nef_nary_union_3, n-ary union of many objects becomes significantly
    faster (more than twice as fast in a test of 20 objects).
    A further optimization potential lies in sorting the unioned objects based on proximity.

  [ SÅawomir Demeszko ]
  * [ff555d7] Preventing loosing keyboard focus by editor. When you write your code in editor sometimes you want to rotate or move object on 3D view, but due stealing focus by this widget it is quite tedious. You need additional mouse click to return focus to editor and search line where you last edited. This behavior is not neccessary as we can interpret keyboard events globally (in MainWindow) and send commands to 3D view.
    Console window need ClickFocus to show context menu.
    Zoom In/Out 3D view is assigned to CTRL+[ and CTRL+]. Adding also additional
    shortcut to zoom in editor font CTRL+= (with CTRL++ SHIFT is necessary).

  [ Torsten Paul ]
  * [7a05fb4] Fix keyboard shortcuts in automatically generated actions (fixes #408).

  * [7f84eb0] Update window title in undocked mode when loading new files.
  * [cb5904d] Overwrite sizeHint() for the editor to handle missing window state information.
    This triggers only in case the configuration file has no window state
    information (or no configuration file at all).
    When this happens, the editor would default to a very ugly width due to
    the dock widget layout. This overwrites the value reported via sizeHint()
    to a width a bit smaller than half the main window size (either the one
    loaded from the configuration or the default value of 800).
    The height is only a dummy value which will be essentially ignored by
    the layouting as the editor is set to expand to fill the available space.

  * [62aebbb] Add encoding of \r.

    For all escape sequences the 0 byte is illegal and converted to a space.

  [ Torsten Paul ]
  * [90ef6c9] Fix render issue with combining chars intersecting with the base char.
    Example: text("A\u030A", font = "Arial");
    The fix relies on the winding order of the polygons reported by FreeType
    to be correct, so the Clipper union operation keeps that information.
  * [f29d10a] Select charmap when loading fonts and add workaround for windows symbol fonts.
  * [d413e46] Use special handling for Windows/Symbol charmap only with charcodes >= 0xf000.
    Some fonts with symbol encoding still have the charcodes in the ASCII
    area instead of Unicode page 0xf000. To make those work too, the special
    handling is only enabled in case the first charcode is >= 0xf000.
  * [0a5acbd] Add test cases for composition and symbol font handling.
  * [e8fac2e] Add example files for text() usage.
    The test case images are currently not including the text as the example
    test run does not include experimental features. This will need to be
    updated once the text() feature is not experimental anymore.

      test, so use this for other tests too
    - drop Amiri bold font, which is not adding anything to coverage
  * [f01afd7] Add paste button to font list dialog.
  * [2b37c39] Add filter for font table.
  * [d0ba290] Enable text for most test cases and update reference images.

  * [d620c8f] Allow localization to be enabled/disabled by configuration settings.
    This is only the logic to check the settings, no GUI.
    Changing the setting requires a restart as disabling localization simply
    skips the call to bindtextdomain() at the application start.

    Especially for the case where the windows are docked as tabs in the
    same position, the "visibility-changed" signal does not work as close
    indicator. The window is also treated as invisible when just the tab
    is invisible, not only in case the window is closed.

  [ Marius Kintel ]
  * [7c677c9] Added text tessellation test

  [ Torsten Paul ]
  * [4306586] Set OPENSCAD_FONT_PATH also for the normal test cases.
    This was already set for the export/import test cases as the exported
    CSG files do not have the use<fontfile> statements. Due to differences
    in the glyphs between the Liberation 2.00.1 we ship and the system
    installed fonts some test cases (e.g. text_on_cube) did also fail.
  * [46bffd3] Move default color scheme back into code.

  * [1d9b664] #899 Updated testcase: Tagged as 2D test

  [ Torsten Paul ]
  * [ca3672b] Move translation files to locale folder instead of po.
    While this is not the standard name for the files, this makes the
    resource handling easier as the PlatformUtils code already handles
    lookup for both installed and dev layouts. At least for Linux the
    installed name would be /usr/share/locale, so we use that in source
    too for now.
  * [99c6175] Remove obsolete LOCALE_PREFIX and update documentation.

  [ mermerico ]
  * [85a91d6] Improved DXF output compatibility.
    Changed coordinate order from [X1 X2 Y1 Y2] to [X1 Y1 X2 Y2]. Both orders are standard compliant but [X1 Y1 X2 Y2] is far more common and can be parsed linearly. Some libraries, like the python libraries dxfgrabber and ezdxf, cannot open [X1 X2 Y1 Y2] order.

  * [407da2e] Move catch for function recursion detection.
    Catching this at ModuleInstantiation::evaluate() should ensure the whole
    function call is terminated with the first exception. Otherwise function
    calls with multiple recursion points (e.g. function f(x) = f(x) + f(x);)

    This is mainly intended to be used for building snapshot binaries that
    are able to install in parallel to a release build. E.g. by using the

  * [1068f61] Add optional menu driven scaling tics to the large axes.
    Tim Deagan 12/26/2014
    While add-on rulers can be extremely useful, there are many times that a quick scaling marker would be handy. This feature generates tics every 10 units, driven off the log10 of the l variable defining axes length.  As you zoom in or out, the tics automatically re-scale themselves.  Every tenth tic is slightly larger.  A menu item is added to the view menu to enable or disable the feature.
    I experimented with menu driven scaling (.01, .1, 1, 10, etc.), but using small increments when zoomed out brought the app to it's knees.  Adding a visual indicator of the current scaling might be nice, but I'm nto sure where to put it (possibly below the small axes,) since it changes as zooming and would clutter the console.

  * [2c89f56] Update GUI to make options a bit clearer for the user.

  [ Tim Deagan ]
  * [4823f26] Addition of function to generate scale maker numeric values on large axes.
    	modified:   src/GLView.cc
    The added function takes the length of the axis (l), the currrent position on the axis (i) and the size of the divisions between i and uses a variety of arrays to decode the characters of the position into GL_LINES, GL_LINE_STRIPs, GL_LINE_LOOPs as appropriate.  The various orientations required by the axis are handled by abstracting the line vertex sequences into arrays (set per axis.)
  * [1826aa9] Addition of header to support function to print scale marker position values on large axes.
    	modified:   src/GLView.h

  [ Torsten Paul ]
  * [9bcb38d] Change settings handling to use Value objects.

  [ Tim Deagan ]

  * [e69513f] #1119 Added missing slot to change tab key function

  [ Torsten Paul ]
  * [8d4d83f] Fix build with Qt4.
  * [bebe084] The WrapFlagInMargin value is only available in QScintilla 2.7 and later.
    This is a workaround for Debian 7 which has QScintilla 2.6.2. The "Margin"
    setting is simply ignored and behaves as "None".

  [ Tim Deagan ]
  * [358ba86] Swap out spaces for tabs.
    	modified:   src/GLView.h
    	modified:   src/MainWindow.h
    	modified:   src/QGLView.h
    	modified:   src/mainwin.cc
    QtCreator ignores the prefs and will only put in spaces instead of tabs.  These are manual fixes in Notepad++ to try and keep the indents in the standard mode.

  [ Torsten Paul ]
  * [7cefaa7] Drop setting the WhitespaceBackgroundColor.
    QScintilla uses this color even when the whitespace is selected instead of
    drawing it in the selection background color. This causes selection to
    look strange when the whitespace display is enabled.

  * [7120497] Use correct eye position in orthogonal projection mode (fixes #1058).
  * [8d401d3] Use viewport height as "distance" for the status text in orthogonal mode.
    While this is not strictly correct as the actual distance has no effect
    in orthogonal mode, it's giving the user an indication of the zoom factor.

  [ Tim Deagan ]
  * [ce5b38d] Add on-launch code to set Document Icon in windows registry.
    Since OpenSCAD doesn't distribute with additional image files, this means a new icon needs to be built into the .exe. This is accomplished by adding a line to the end of openscad_win32.rc file consisting of something like the following:
    IDI_ICON2 ICON DISCARDABLE "icons/openscad_doc.ico"
    which will get built into the exe as icon index 1 (icon index 0 is the current app icon.)
    In the cmdline and gui functions in openscad.cc I added code to set the HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Classes/OpenSCAD_File/DefaultIcon/Default value to the icon index 1 of openscad.exe

  * [303217d] Always set both height and viewer_distance (fixes #1153).
    The only exception is the initialization in the Constructor which seems
    to matter for the test suite where the Camera is initialized with type
    NONE. This still needs some investigation as unifying both variables into
    a single one does break tests on Travis (but not locally).

  * [47f5815] Fix problem with check-dependencies.sh during detection of qt under some circumstances.
    - If qtchooser is installed but qmake could not be found (either qt4
      or qt5), the check would hang due to grep expecting input from
      stdin.
    - If qtchooser is installed but qmake for qt5 is not installed, the
      code would not actually check for the existence of qt4 qmake, since
      the test for ! -e $qtpath doesn't do what you want when $qtpath is
      empty.

  * [7b39f45] fix building of remaining binaries
    the previous patch has removed the -DENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL flag, assuming
    that it is not required any more without openscad_nogui being built.
    while that is sufficient for the test suite, other binaries built in the
    tests/ directory would still use those flags.
    in order to make them buildable again, the -DOPENSCAD_NOGUI compile time
    option is added (as the resulting binaries are command-line-only tools,
    which was previously implicit by setting -DOPENSCAD_TESTING), and
    -DENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL is restored.
